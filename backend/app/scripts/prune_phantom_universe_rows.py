"""One-time prune of phantom ``StockUniverse`` rows that collapse on canonicalization.

A row is a *phantom* when its stored symbol re-canonicalizes (via the security
master resolver) to a *different* symbol that already exists as its own row — e.g.
a TW ``1240.TWO`` row carrying the TWSE ``XTAI`` exchange, which canonicalizes to
``1240.TW`` (the genuine sibling). Such duplicates are what crashed weekly-bundle
import on the ``StockUniverse.symbol`` unique index; the import path now collapses
them automatically, so published bundles self-heal on the next weekly cycle. This
script is for any *persistent* universe DB (local dev, a long-running deployment)
that won't re-import a bundle soon and should be cleaned proactively.

Idempotent and safe to re-run. A genuine standalone ``.TWO`` (exchange ``TPEX``,
no ``.TW`` sibling) canonicalizes to itself and is never pruned.

Usage:
    python -m app.scripts.prune_phantom_universe_rows [--market TW] [--dry-run]
